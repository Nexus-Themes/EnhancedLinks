PR's are also welcome!

### Regarding Fediverse (for now)
Due to the ability to selfhost your own instance of a given platform on the Fediverse (For example, Mastodon) I will not be adding support for these domains. There are too many unique domains to worry about, which pads the theme file unnecessarily.<br>
